# Requirements and Goals of the System.

## Functional Requirements:

1. Given their location (longitude/latitude), drivers should be able to update location.
2. Drivers should be able to be notified when new version of the app released.

## Non-functional Requirements: 

1. Drivers should have real-time location tracking experience with minimum latency.
2. Our service should support heavy work load. There will be a lot of update requests.
