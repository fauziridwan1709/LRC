# ⚙️ Firebase Remote Config with Google Analytic

[firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/config-analytics) states "When you build an app that includes both Firebase Remote Config and Google Analytics, you gain the ability to understand your app users better and to respond to their needs more quickly. You can use Analytics audiences and user properties to customize your app for segments of your user base with flexibility and precision."

## Benefit.

1. Make updates without republishing.
2. gives you visibility and fine-grained control over your app's behavior and appearance so you can make changes by simply updating its configuration from the Firebase console.
3. Confidently/Progressively roll out new features. feature flags so you can gradually roll out new features to ensure they are stable and performing well, before rolling them out broadly. If the new features don't meet expectations or cause crashes, you can quickly roll them back.
4. Personalize your app for different audiences

## Versioning

Using Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Major.Minor.Patch

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
